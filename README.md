# TnT Board
TnT Board is a javascript library for displaying track-based annotations in the web. It is part of the the [TnT](http://emepyc.github.io/tnt/) set of visualisation libraries to display trees and track-based visualisations, although it can be used independently of any other TnT library. It has been designed with a powerful [API](http://emepyc.github.io/tnt.board/api/index.html), written with flexibility in mind, that allows the creation of expressive, dynamic and powerful track-based visualizations.

TnT Board defines several elements to facilitate the creation of visualisations: a board that is a container for tracks, tracks that are independent units of data representation, data retrievers to get the data synchronously or asynchronously and visual features to display the available data.
