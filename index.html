<h2><a name="introduction" href="#introduction">#</a>Introduction</h2>
<p><b>TnT Board</b> is a javascript library for displaying track-based annotations in the web. It is part of the the <a href="">TnT</a> set of visualisation libraries to display trees and/or track-based visualisations. It has been designed with a powerful API, written with flexibility in mind, that allows the creation of expressive, dynamic and powerful track-based visualizations.</p>

<p>TnT Board defines several elements to facilitate the creation of visualisations: a board that is a container for tracks, tracks that are independent units of data representation, data retrievers to get the data synchronously or asynchronously and visual features to display the available data</p>

<h3>Boards</h3>
<p>In TnT Board, a board is an interactive container for tracks. Each panning or zoom event in the board triggers new data and visualisation updates in the attached tracks. New boards are created using the tnt.<a href="#board">board</a> method. Once it is created new tracks can be attached using the board.<a href="#add_track">add_track</a> method. Boards are configured via several methods that are fully explained in the API page.</p>

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
var myBoard = tnt.board()
    .from(0)
    .to(1000)
    .min(0)
    .max(1000);
myBoard
    .add_track(track1)
    .add_track(track2);

myBoard(document.getElementyById('DOM_element_id'));
myBoard.start();
{% endhighlight %}

<p>As exemplified above, the <i>board</i> itself (returned by tnt.board) is a function that when executed initialises the visualisation using the provided <i>DOM element</i> as its DOM container. After initialistion, the <i>board</i> is started, which means that the data is retrieved and displayed. It is important to understand these three states of the visualisation:</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Defined</b>: The board instance is defined at the code level, but the visualisation hasn't been inisialised and the container is still empty</li>
  <li><b>Initialised</b>: The container is populated with the board elements</li>
  <li><b>Started</b>: The tracks are created, their data retrieved and the features plotted</li>
</ul>


<h3>Tracks</h3>
<p>In TnT Board, tracks are independent units of data representation, which means that each track is independent from each other and defines its own way of data retrieval and representation. At track definition, each new track selects how the data for the track is retrieved (either "synchronously" or "asynchronously") and displayed. TnT offers predefined common displays (like rectangles, lines, areas, pins, etc) ready to use and new displays can also be created using the <a href="www.d3js.org">d3</a> library. Composite displays are also allowed and a very powerful tool for displaying complex data. One of the main characteristics of TnT tracks is the separation of concerns between data retrieval and data representation. Check the API documentation for a full list of methods available for tracks, data retrievals and displays</p>

<p>Examples are a fundamental part of TnT documentation. Check them in the examples page</p>
  {% highlight javascript linenos %}
  var myBoard = tnt.board().from(0).to(500).left(0).right(500);

  var axisTrack = tnt.board.track()
      .height(20)
      .color("white")
      .display(tnt.board.track.feature.axis())
      .orientation("top");

  var blockTrack = tnt.board.track()
      .height(30)
      .color("#FFCFDD")
      .data (tnt.board.track.data.sync()
          .retriever(function () {
              return [{
                  start : 200,
                  end : 350
              }];
          })
      )
      .display(tnt.board.track.feature.block()
          .color("blue")
          .index(function (d) {
              return d.start;
          })
      );

  // Attach the tracks to the board (order matters)
  myBoard
      .add_track(location_track)
      .add_track(block_track);

  // Start the board
  myBoard(document.getElementById("mydiv"));
  {% endhighlight %}

<p>The above example starts by defining a board that displays data from position 0 to 500, being the minimum (0) and maximum (1000) coordinates. The code also defines two tracks and each of them defines how the data is retrieved and displayed. Once defined, the tracks are attached to the board. The first one is a <a href="locationTRAck">location track -- BROKEN LINK</a> with top orientation. The second track is 30 pixels high and displays one block from position 200 to 350 in the board. Once the board is configure the visualisation is ready to start.</p>


<h2><a name="installation" href="#installation">#</a>Installation</h2>
<p>TnT Board can be linked directly from the github repo. It depends on <a href="http://d3js.org">d3js</a> and this library needs to be linked before tnt.board</p>

{% highlight html linenos %}
<link rel="stylesheet" href="http://emepyc.github.io/tnt/build/tnt.board.css" type="text/css" />
<script src="http://d3js.org/d3.v3.min.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<script src="http://emepyc.github.io/tnt/build/tnt.board.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
{% endhighlight %}

<p>It is also possible to install the source code and build the library locally. This can be achieved either by using <b>npm</b> or <b>github</b>:</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        Using <b>npm</b>:
        {% highlight bash %}
npm install tnt.board
        {% endhighlight %}
    </li>
    <li>
        Building from <b>Git</b>:
        {% highlight bash %}
git clone https://github.com/emepyc/tnt.board
cd tnt.board
npm install
npm build-browser
        {% endhighlight %}
    </li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="browsers" href="#browsers">#</a>Browser support</h2>
<p>TnT works on HTML5, CSS3 and SVG-compliant browser, which generally means any "modern browser". The TnT library and themes are tested regularly against Chrome (Chromium) and major changes are regularly tested in recent versions of Firefox, Safari (Webkit) and Opera. It has been also tested in IE versions 9+. If you find any problem, please <a href="https://github.com/emepyc/tnt/issues">let me know</a>.</p>

<p>The TnT library depends on the <a href="http://d3js.org">D3.js</a> library. Check its <a href="https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki#browser--platform-support">browser's compatibility note</a> for more information.</p>
